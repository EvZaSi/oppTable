# oppTable

A table to show ice cream sales for all parlors in a given city. On load, this table shows all ice cream sales for all ice cream parlors. The end user has a dropdown to filter by city, which, after being selected, causes the table to rerender with ice cream sales in that city only. When the table is filtered, the total sales ($) for that city are shown at the top of the table.
